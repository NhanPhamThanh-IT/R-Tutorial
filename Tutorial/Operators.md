An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. R language is rich in built-in operators and provides following types of operators.

### Part 1 - Types of Operators

We have the following types of operators in R programming:

- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Miscellaneous Operators

### Part 2 - Arithmetic Operators

Following table shows the arithmetic operators supported by R language. The operators act on each element of the vector.

<table align='center'>
    <tr align='center'>
        <th>Operator</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>+</td>
        <td>Adds two vectors</td>
        <td>
            <pre>
v <- c( 2,5.5,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v+t)
-> [1] 10.0  8.5  10.0
            </pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
